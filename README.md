Key Features:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Includes data loading, handling missing values (if any), and feature scaling.
BIRCH Clustering: Implements the BIRCH algorithm to cluster the data, exploring its efficiency for large datasets.
DBSCAN Clustering: Implements the DBSCAN algorithm to identify clusters of varying shapes and sizes, including handling noise effectively. Â  
Model Evaluation: Evaluates the performance of both algorithms using metrics such as Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, and visualization techniques.
Comparison and Discussion: Compares and contrasts the results of BIRCH and DBSCAN, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in terms of performance, scalability, and suitability for different types of data.
